# Brevity Go

This project aims to be a production-ready template for my future attempts at building an backend server. The codebase should have the following features:

- [ ] OpenAPI design files and toolings to check for backward compatibility.
- [ ] Sensible API design.
- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration: metric, tracing and log.
- [ ] Dependency injection for easier testing. May use tools like `wire` to automatically inject dependencies.
- [ ] Repository tests that use **real** database.
- [ ] Mocking dependencies while testing. Table testing.
- [ ] Sensible way to configure the application for different environment.
- [ ] Sensible database migration mechanism.
- [ ] Built into a Docker image with relatively optimized `Dockerfile`.
- [ ] Have a full-fledged local development environment.
- [ ] Utilizes CI toolings like Github actions for code quality checking.
- [ ] Have an extendable and maintainable project structure.
- [ ] Contains mechanism for keeping track of the application performance.
- [ ] Handling errors in a sensible way.
- [ ] (maybe) E2E tests.
